# My Python + AI Journey
This repo tracks my progress in learning Python, data science, and applied AI.


## About me

Hi, I'm Victoria — a self-taught learner based in Italy.  
I explore Python, Data Science, and applied AI by building real projects.  
I speak Italian, Russian, and English. German is next on the list.


## Tech Stack

- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebooks (Juno on iPad)  
- Git & GitHub  
- NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn  
- SQL (planned)  
- scikit-learn, PyTorch  
- Foundational ML math & statistics  
- Prompt engineering, GPT-based tools, LangChain  
- API integration (OpenAI, etc.)  
- FastAPI, Render (cloud deployment)  
- CI/CD, Docker, testing  
- Blog + automation workflows
