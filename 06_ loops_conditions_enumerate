# This script demonstrates two key Python concepts:
# 1. Filtering numbers with a for loop and condition
# 2. Using enumerate() to iterate with index and value

# Print numbers from 1 to 20 that are NOT divisible by 3
print("Numbers from 1 to 20 that are not divisible by 3:")
for x in range(1, 21):
    if x % 3 != 0:
        print(x)

# Same output using a list comprehension
print("\nSame result using list comprehension:")
print([y for y in range(1, 21) if y % 3 != 0])

# Demonstrating enumerate() with a list of fruits
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print("\nEnumerating fruits with their indexes:")
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"{index}: {fruit}")

# This program collects 5 numbers from the user,
# stores them in a list, and calculates their total sum and average (mean).

i = 1
total = 0
all_nums = []

while i <= 5:
    num = int(input(f"Insert number #{i} of 5: "))
    all_nums.append(num)
    total += num
    i += 1

# Display all entered numbers
print(f"All numbers: {all_nums}")

# Display the total sum and the average
print(f"The sum is {total}")
print(f"The average is {total / 5}")



# Filter positive and negative numbers from a mixed list

# Original list with positive, negative, and zero values
numbers = [4, -1, 7, 0, -3, 10, -5]

# Create empty lists for results
positive = []
negative = []

# Loop through numbers and classify them
for num in numbers:
    if num > 0:
        positive.append(num)
    elif num < 0:
        negative.append(num)

# Show results
print(f"Positive numbers: {positive}")
print(f"Negative numbers: {negative}")
print("Zero values are ignored")  # тут f не нужен, потому что нет переменных
